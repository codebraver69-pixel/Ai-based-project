Project Name: KitaBook

Group: Group 4

-What this project does:
Kitabook is an app where people are able to trade books for cheaper prices and set up a meeting spot with someone to buy them

-AI I used:
V0.dev for the main css and html(it was simple to use but it takes alot more time than other AI)(8/10)
Windsurf to fix the hero(once you write a question it usually responds with something unrelated)(6/10)
Github copilot to make everything JS related like the chat, book listing...(simplest AI, really useful and pretty fast)(10/10)
Hotjar AI for recommendations(the instructions are very unclear)(5/10)

-Steps:
First you open the website and can choose whether you want to browse books,sell or message someone. If you click on browse you'll see multiple books with acceptable prices,
afterwards you can contact this person to set up a meeting place. Also you can list your very own book with your price,condition and location. Lastly you are able to message the website so it can help you find a book that suits you.
